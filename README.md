A simple game of rock paper scissors

This is a simple terminal-based rock paper scissors game.

The skills that I've learned from this project:
    A good understanding of conditional statements.
    Using return statements in a function.
    Using while loops.
    Utilizing specific items within an array.
    Breaking a problem down and solving it in smaller pieces.


NOTES:
    I included two testing inputs ('Gun' and 'Fish'). Gun was a reference to something I used to do with my friends when I was a kid. If you chose gun in rock paper scissors you always won, because "guns always win". The 'fish' I was referencing was the Pokemon 'Magikarp', because if you're using a magikarp, odds are you will lose.
